Library
=======

Design: This concept and initial structure was created as an assignment by Professor Dave Matuszek at the University of Pennsylvania. All implementation details and code developed by Ryan Smith and Steve Schenkel.

Program to run the basic functions of a public/private library.

Use: This file does not have a GUI. It is intended to be run from the command line by navigating to the containing folder and running python RunLibrary.py. Note: All other classes and text file containing initial collection of books must be contained in the same folder.

Other Info: The program and unit tests are written in Python. 
-An initial collection of books was provided by Dr. Matuszek and is included as a text file titled collection.txt.
-The close() command was designed for daily use while opening and closing the library. The quit() command is for use only if the library is to close for good. Patrons and books in the collections at the time of quit will not be saved.
